          Overview

        <p class="lead">
          Learn how to make a mobile city building Unity game with the city builder
          game starter kit available on the Unity Asset Store and also from <a href="http://www.citybuildingkit.com">CityBuildingKit.com</a>. This kit includes a basic framework for buildings, characters,
          HUD and gameboard actions. The following Unity tutorial documentation describes how to
          test on your mobile device out of the box, understand the HUD and edit
          buildings and characters plus unity script references for your game development. Get started with this starter kit for Unity Mobile games.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Requirements: </b>
          NGUI and 2D Toolkit are required to run the starter kit. As per NGUI's
          team instructions, NGUI should be imported in a new empty scene, not directly
          in the game scene (throws a few internal NGUI errors otherwise). Safer
          to apply this to 2dToolKit as well.&nbsp;

          1. Open the starter kit in Unity. As mentioned above, NGUI should be imported in a new empty scene, not directly in the game
          scene (throws a few internal NGUI errors otherwise). Safer to apply this
          to 2dToolKit as well.
          <br>
          <br>2. Connect your iPhone and make sure Xcode is downloaded and installed
          on your Mac. If you haven't already, check that you've run a test app from
          Apple correctly on your iOS device and have your team keychain configured.
          When ready, open the project in Unity.
          <div>
            <div>
              <br>3. Click

                <b>Build and Run</b>
                <div>
                  <br>5. Wait a moment while Unity builds the app, launches Xcode, and
                  installs on your phone. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

        </h1>
        <p class="lead"><a name="ui"></a>
          This Starter Kit has been tested and deployed with all iOS devices (iPhone 5, iPod, iPad 1). Also tested on Android (Samsung Galaxy S), desktop and web deployment. All with great performance. With some devices, you may notice blanks between titles. This is a NGUI/Unity glitch; going around it requires modifications for the texture filtering and/or position snap in Unity (already done many times, but the position appears to drift a little, just enough to make it visible on Android). It appears that it behaves differently on different platforms - at this point, it's obviously not visible on either iPhone, iPod, MAC or PC.

        </p>
        <div>
          <b>Like all 2D isometric mobile games, the menu options are accessable from large buttons on the interface. From top to bottom, these are:</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>- XP Bar<br></b>
          Value increases as buildings are produced and XP is gained (Standard in any 2D Building games)
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>- Developer Controls<br></b>
          Use these arrows or zoom buttons for movement on non-iOS devices such as a desktop test. Hide in gameplay after development (Useful with this Unity Development Kit)
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>- Builders Available<br></b>
          One building in construction is possible for every builder available and
          not currently used. On tap opens the in-game purchase menu to purchase
          additional builders. (Seen in other Unity social games)
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>- Resources / Soft-Currency #1 and #2</b>
          &nbsp;
          <br>
          Gold and Mana. Replace with your own terminology like Wood, Stone, Elixir, Silver, etc. Starts with predefined
          values as specified in the XML of this casual game template. More can be purchased or generated in the game with resource producing
          buildings included in the Unity game starter kits.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>- Gems / Jewels / Hard-Currency Used in Unity Social Mobile Games</b>
          &nbsp;
          <br>
          Click to buy more, perfect for your mobile game commercial template. Used to speed up time sensitive tasks. Cannot be generated
          in the game like soft-currencies. Require the use of funds to get. Click
          to buy more in the in-game menu. (The best asset template to monetize what users buy)
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>- Competitions</b>
          &nbsp;
          <br>
          Prefab asset coming soon. Requires players to produce certain buildings or characters
          before they can compete. A way to expend the character's developed and turn this into a true Unity social game.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>- Achievements <br></b>
          Coming soon. Focuses players on doing certain tasks to get XP rewards.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>- Building Options <br></b>
          These show only when a building is selected. The example buttons include Upgrade to improve a building,
          Move, and Delete options.
          <br><br><b>- Settings</b>
          Control in-game settings like sound and music in this Unity Asset
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>- Building &amp; Character Shop <br></b>
          The central part of the game for purchasing and shopping for new items in this template game starter kit.

                In-App Purchases are setup as a demo right now in <b>HardPriceProc.cs</b> and don't connect directly to iOS or Android In-App Purchase routines. You will need to <a href="http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/17180/iphone-in-app-purchase-tutorial.html">write your own In-App Purchase code</a> or get an asset such as <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/3114">Prime31</a> or <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/5767">Unibill</a>. Test by clicking the <b>plus button (+)</b> next to the gems or construction workers in the menu buttons on the main screen.<br><br>
                The <b>HardPriceProc.cs</b> script processes the total amount based on the info in <b>HardPrice.xml</b> (see below for XML excerpt). You can add and substract a total value. The <b>totalPrice</b> float variable must reach the solution you've picked for real online purchases. <a href="http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/17180/iphone-in-app-purchase-tutorial.html">Create and test with this advice</a> or get an asset such as <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/3114">Prime31</a> or <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/5767">Unibill</a>.
